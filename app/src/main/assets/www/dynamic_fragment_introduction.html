        <h2>Define Fragments Dynamically</h2>

        <p>
            Real power of Fragments comes to the action when at the runtime your program
            decides which Fragment to display based on the screen orientation.
            Many a times you need a scenario when you want to display different
            user interface when screen changes its orientation from portrait to
            land­scape. We can customize the UI at the runtime using Fragments.
            Say for example you activity looks good and fills the entire screen when
            opened in mobile but when opened in tablet which has the bigger screen size
            than phones then your activity does not fill the screen and may appear less
            attractive, in these cases you can display more con­tent but manipulating with the Fragments.

        <h3>How Would It Work:</h3>

        <p>
            •&emsp;First thing you need to use FragmentManager instance to get FragmentTransaction instance.&ensp;<br/>
            •&emsp;FragmentTransaction instance is to perform fragment
            transactions which means you can add, remove and replace the fragments.&ensp;<br/>
            •&emsp;In the next page example, Fragment changes when device changes it orientation.
            Fragment1 will be displayed when device is in portrait mode and Fragment2
            will be displayed when device is in the land­scape mode.&ensp;<br/>
            •&emsp;Then you can get by "getResources().getConfiguration().orientation;".&ensp;<br/>
            •&emsp;Create two Fragment java files which extend Fragment Class.&ensp;<br/>
            •&emsp;Declare the Fragment as &lt;FrameLayout&gt; a element inside the activity’s layout file.&ensp;<br/>

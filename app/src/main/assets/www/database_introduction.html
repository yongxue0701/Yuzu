        <h2>Introduction of SQLite</h2>

        <h3>1.&emsp;SQLite and Android</h3>

        <p>
            <b>a)&emsp;What is SQLite ?</b><br/>
            SQLite is an Open Source Database which is embedded into Android.
            SQLite supports standard relational database features like SQL syntax,
            transactions and prepared statements.<br/><br/>
            In addition it requires only little memory at runtime (approx. 250 KByte).<br/><br/>
            SQLite supports the data types TEXT (similar to String in Java),
            INTEGER (similar to long in Java) and REAL (similar to double in Java).
            All other types must be converted into one of these fields before saving
            them in the database. SQLite itself does not validate if the types
            written to the columns are actually of the defined type, you can
            write an integer into a string column.<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>b)&emsp;SQLite in Android</b><br/>
            SQLite is available on every Android device. Using an SQLite database
            in Android does not require any database setup or administration.
            You specify the SQL for working with the database and the database
            is automatically managed for you.<br/><br/>
            Working with databases can be slow. Therefore is it recommended to perform these
            task in the background, for example via an AsyncTask.<br/><br/>
            If your application creates an database this database is saved in the directory
            DATA/data/ APP_NAME/ databases/ FILENAME.DATA is the path which
            Environment.getDataDirectory() returns, APP_NAME is your application
            name and FILENAME is the name you give the database during creation.
            Environment.getDataDirectory() usually return the SD card as location.<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>c)&emsp;Content Provider and sharing data</b><br/>
            A SQLite database is private to the application which creates it. If you
            want to share data with other applications you can use a ContentProvider.
            If data is not shared it typically easier to work directly with the database.
        </p>

        <h3>2.&emsp;Android Architecture</h3>

        <p>
            <b>a)&emsp;Packages</b><br/>
            The package android.database contains all general classes for working
            with databases. android.database.sqlite contains the SQLite specific classes.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>b)&emsp;SQLiteOpenHelper</b><br/>
            To create and upgrade a database in your Android application you usually subclass
            SQLiteOpenHelper. In this class you need to override the methods onCreate()
            to create the database and onUpgrade() to upgrade the database in case of
            changes in the database schema. Both methods receive an SQLiteDatabase
            object which represents the database.<br/><br/>

            SQLiteOpenHelper provides the methods getReadableDatabase() and
            getWriteableDatabase() to get access to an SQLiteDatabase object
            which allows database access either in read or write mode.<br/><br/>

            For the primary key of the database tables you should always use the
            identifier _id as some of Android functions rely on this standard.<br/><br/>

            A best practice is to create per table a separate class which define static
            onCreate() and onUpdate() methods. These methods are then called in the
            corresponding methods of SQLiteOpenHelper . This way your implementation
            of SQLiteOpenHelper will not get to large even if you have several tables.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>c)&emsp;SQLiteDatabase</b><br/>
            SQLiteDatabase is the base class for working with an SQLite database in Android
            and provides methods to open, query, update and close the database.
            More specifically SQLiteDatabase provides the insert(), update() and
            delete() methods. The execSQL() method allows to execute directly SQL.
            The object ContentValues allow to define key/values for insert and update.
            The key is the column and the value is the value for this column.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>d)&emsp;Cursor</b><br/>
            A query returns always a Cursor. A Cursor represents the result of a query
            and basically points always to one row of the database. This way Android
            can buffer the results efficiently as it does not have to load all data
            into memory.<br/><br/>

            To get the number of elements use the method getCount(). To move between
            individual data rows, you can use the methods moveToFirst() and moveToNext().
            Via the method isAfterLast() you can check if there is still some data.<br/><br/>

            To access data Cursor provides typed get methods, e.g. getLong(columnIndex), getString(columnIndex)
            whereby the columnIndex is the number of the column you are accessing.<br/><br/>

            A Cursor can be directly used via the SimpleCursorAdapter in ListViews

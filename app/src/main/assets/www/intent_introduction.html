        <h2>Introduction of Fragments</h2>

        <p>
            An Intent is a messaging object you can use to request an action from another
            app component. Although intents facilitate communication between components
            in several ways, there are three fundamental use cases:
        </p>

        <p>
            •&emsp;<b>Starting an activity</b><br/>
            An Activity represents a single screen in an app. You can start a new instance of
            an Activity by passing an Intent to startActivity(). The Intent describes the
            activity to start and carries any necessary data.<br/><
            If you want to receive a result from the activity when it finishes, call
            startActivityForResult(). Your activity receives the result as a separate
            Intent object in your activity's onActivityResult() callback.<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            •&emsp;<b>Starting a service</b><br/>
            A Service is a component that performs operations in the background without a
            user interface. With Android 5.0 (API level 21) and later, you can start a
            service with JobScheduler.<br/>
            For versions earlier than Android 5.0 (API level 21), you can start a
            service by using methods of the Service class. You can start a service
            to perform a one-time operation (such as downloading a file) by passing
            an Intent to startService(). The Intent describes the service to
            start and carries any necessary data.<br/>
            If the service is designed with a client-server interface, you can bind
            to the service from another component by passing an Intent to bindService().<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            •&emsp;<b>Delivering a broadcast</b><br/>
            A broadcast is a message that any app can receive. The system delivers various
            broadcasts for system events, such as when the system boots up or the device
            starts charging. You can deliver a broadcast to other apps by passing an Intent
            to sendBroadcast() or sendOrderedBroadcast(). It will be introduced
            in the next course in details.<br/>
            <br/><b>Example of starting an activity:</b>
        </p>

        <p id="first_code">
            Intent myIntent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), Act1.class);<br/>
            startActivity(myIntent);<br/>
        </p>
    </body>

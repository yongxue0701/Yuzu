        <h2>Define Fragments Statically</h2>

        <p>
            There are two ways to add Fragments to an Activity, either static
            fragments or Dynamic fragments. Adding fragments statically via XML is the
            preferred method when your UI won’t vary drastically. You can use these XML
            fragments and leverage the resource system to build UIs that fit multiple
            form factors without worrying about managing the state of all the fragments
            in your application.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will see how to add Static Fragments to an Activity, by Declare the Fragment
            as &lt;fragment&gt; a element inside the activity’s layout file.
        </p>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <p>
            •&emsp;Create MainActivity.java file and extends Activity.&ensp;<br/>
            •&emsp;Create Fragment1.java and Fragment2.java which extends the Fragment Class.<br/>
            •&emsp;Create the respective layouts for Fragment1 and Fragment2.<br/>
            •&emsp;Override onCreateView() method in Fragment1.java and Fragment2.java,
            and inflate the Fragment layouts (R.id.Fragment1 and R.id.Fragment2)
            using LayoutInflater Class object and by passing the ViewGroup argument
            which is the activity in which the fragment will be embedded.<br/>

        <h2>Introduction of Permissions</h2>

        <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Android Permissions Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            System permissions have different levels, e.g., protection levels.<br/><br/>

            The permission concept has changed since API 23. Before API level 23 the user
            was asked during installation, after API level the user is asked during runtime.<br/><br/>

            An Android application declares the required permissions in its
            Android manifest. It can also define additional permissions which
            it can use to restrict access to certain components.
        </p>

        <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Android Permissions before API 23</h3>

        <p>
            Before API 23 the requested permissions are presented to the user before
            installing the application. The user needs to decide if these permissions
            shall be given to the application.<br/><br/>
            If the user denies a required permission, the related application cannot
            be installed. The check of the permission is only performed during installation.
            Permissions cannot be denied or granted after the installation. Many of you
            have come across this, when installing many of the apps from the Google Play store.
        </p>

        <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Runtime Permissions</h3>

        <p>
            Android 6.0 Marshmallow (API 23) introduced a new runtime permission model.
            If your application targets Android 6.0, you must use the new permissions model.<br/><br/>
            The two most important protection levels are normal and dangerous permissions:<br/>
            •&emsp;<b>Normal permissions</b> are permissions which are deemed harmless for the users privacy
            or the operation of other applications. For example, the permission to set the time
            zone. Normal permission are automatically granted to the application. See Normal
            permissions for a complete list.<br/>
            •&emsp;<b>Dangerous permissions</b> affect the users private information, or could potentially
            affect his data or the operation of other application. For example, the ability
            to read the users contact data. Dangerous permissions must be granted by the
            user at runtime to the app.
        </p>

        <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Android Permissions In Manifest File</h3>

        <p>
            You need to define a permission in the android application manifest file before
            restricting access to any application component. Use the permission tag to create
            the permission definitions. The application components can then require them by
            adding the android:permission attribute. Other apps will then need to include
            a uses-permission tag in their manifest file and have it granted before they
            can use these protected components.<br/><br/>
            Within the permission tag you can specify the level of access the permission
            will permit( normal, dangerous, signature, signatureOrSystem), a label, and an
            external resource containing the description that explains the risks of
            granting this permission.

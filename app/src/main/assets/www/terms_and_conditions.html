                <b>1.&emsp;Subject and Scope</b><br/>
                1.1&emsp;Android Master company, NUS School of Computing, COM1, 13 Computing Drive,
                117417 (thereafter “AndroidMaster”) operates mobile applications (“app”)
                with interactive courses on computer science, programming, and related topics.<br/><br/>
                1.2&emsp;Use of the apps shall be exclusively subject to the following terms and conditions.<br/><br/>
                1.3&emsp;No special contractual text is intended for the contract regarding use of
                the AndroidMaster app. The content of the contract concluded between you and
                AndroidMaster follows these general terms and conditions as well as the information
                provided during the process of registration that will be saved by AndroidMaster and
                available at any time in your user account.<br/><br/>
                1.4&emsp;By registering for and/or using AndroidMaster’s services, you accept the
                application of these terms and conditions.<br/><br/>
                1.5&emsp;AndroidMaster shall retain the right to change individual clauses with effect for
                the future. If AndroidMaster does not obtain your specific consent for an amendment of
                its terms and conditions, you will be informed of any changes to the terms and
                conditions at least four weeks prior to the effective date of the updated terms and
                conditions. For this purpose, AndroidMaster will deliver the updated terms and
                conditions to the email address provided during registration and notify you explicitly
                regarding the opportunity and objection period against the changes and consequences of
                an omitted objection.<br/><br/>
                1.6&emsp;If you do not object to the changes within four weeks after the effective
                date of the updated terms and conditions, the updated terms and conditions shall
                be deemed accepted. The period shall start with the day that it is communicated to
                you via email as the effective date of change.<br/><br/>
                1.7&emsp;In the event that you object the changes, AndroidMaster shall be entitled
                to terminate the user contract and delete your user account, under consideration
                of your interests if continuing of the contractual relationship under the scope
                of the current terms and conditions is not possible or unreasonable for
                AndroidMaster, effective from the date the updated terms and conditions
                come into force.

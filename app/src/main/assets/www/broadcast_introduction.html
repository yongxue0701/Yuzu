        <h2>Introduction of Broadcast</h2>

        <p>
            Android apps can send or receive broadcast messages from the Android system and
            other Android apps, similar to the publish-subscribe design pattern. These broadcasts
            are sent when an event of interest occurs. For example, the Android system sends
            broadcasts when various system events occur, such as when the system boots up or
            the device starts charging. Apps can also send custom broadcasts, for example,
            to notify other apps of something that they might be interested in (for example,
            some new data has been downloaded).<br/><br/>
            Apps can register to receive specific broadcasts. When a broadcast is sent,
            the system automatically routes broadcasts to apps that have subscribed
            to receive that particular type of broadcast.<br/><br/>
            Generally speaking, broadcasts can be used as a messaging system across apps and
            outside of the normal user flow. However, you must be careful not to abuse the
            opportunity to respond to broadcasts and run jobs in the background that can
            contribute to a slow system performance, as described in the following video.<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> To set up a broadcast receiver, include the following in the
            activity from which you want to listen to broadcast:
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Include also the following in the activity from which you
            want to listen to broadcast:
        </p>

        <p id="second_code">
            MyBroadcastReceiver myReceiver;<br/>
            IntentFilter myIntentFilter;
        </p>

        <p>
            In the onCreate method, add:
        </p>

        <p id="third_code">
            myReceiver = new MyBroadcastReceiver();<br/>
            myIntentFilter = new IntentFilter(“broadcast");
        </p>

        <p>
            Register the receiver in onResume() :
        </p>

        <p id="fourth_code">
            registerReceiver(myReceiver, myIntentFilter);
        </p>

        <p>
            Unregister the receiver in onPause():
        </p>

        <p id="fifth_code">
            unregisterReceiver(myReceiver);
        </p>

        <p>
            To send a broadcast (can be from a different activity):
        </p>

        <p id="sixth_code">
            Intent i = new Intent(“broadcast");<br/>
            i.putExtra("key", "some value from intent");<br/>
            sendBroadcast(i);
        </p>

        <p>
            Can also define a receiver through the AndroidManifest.xml file:
        </p>

        <p id="seventh_code">
            &lt;receiver android:name=".SecondReceiver"&gt;<br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;&lt;intent-filter&gt;<br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;action android:name=“broadcast"/&gt;<br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;&lt;/intent-filter&gt;<br/>
            &lt;/receiver&gt;
        </p>

        <p>
            Then define a SecondReceiver class to listen to broadcast:
        </p>

        <p id="first_code">
            @Override<br/>
            public void onReceive<br/>
            (Context context, Intent i) {<br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;Toast.makeText(context, <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;"I am in broadcast receiver, "<br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;+ "message received = " <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;+ i.getStringExtra("key"),<br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();<br/>
            }
        </p>
    </body>

        <h2>Android Activity</h2>

        <p>
            Activity class is very important component of Android. Activity is like single screen
            with user interface just like frame of java. We know any executable program written
            in Java or C++ have a main() method and programs are launched with main() method.
            Instead of main method Android has a different concept of activity.<br/><br/>
            Most of the apps contains multiple screens which means they have multiple activities.
            Activities are registered in appâ€™s manifest file. Each activity has its own life cycle
            you must manage properly.<br/><br/>

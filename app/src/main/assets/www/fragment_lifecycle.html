                Here is the list of methods which you can to override in your fragment class
            </p>

        <div>
            <p>
                •&emsp;<b>onAttach()</b> The fragment instance is associated with an activity instance.
                The fragment and the activity is not fully initialized.
                Typically you get in this method a reference to the activity which uses the fragment
                for further initialization work.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;<b>onCreate()</b> The system calls this method when creating the fragment.
                You should initialize essential components of the fragment that you want to
                retain when the fragment is paused or stopped, then resumed.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;<b>onCreateView()</b> The system calls this callback when it's time for the fragment
                to draw its user interface for the first time. To draw a UI for your fragment,
                you must return a View component from this method that is the root of your
                fragment's layout. You can return null if the fragment does not provide a UI.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;<b>onActivityCreated()</b> The onActivityCreated() is called after the onCreateView()
                method when the host activity is created. Activity and fragment instance have been
                created as well as the view hierarchy of the activity. At this point, view can
                be accessed with the findViewById() method. example. In this method you can instantiate
                objects which require a Context object.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;<b>onStart()</b> The onStart() method is called once the fragment gets visible.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;<b>onResume()</b> Fragment becomes active.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;<b>onPause()</b> The system calls this method as the first indication that the user is
                leaving the fragment. This is usually where you should commit any changes that should
                be persisted beyond the current user session.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;<b>onStop()</b> Fragment going to be stopped by calling onStop().&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;<b>onDestroyView()</b> Fragment view will destroy after call this method.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;<b>onDestroy()</b> called to do final clean up of the fragment's state
                but Not guaranteed to be called by the Android platform.&ensp;<br/>

        <h2>Introduction of Fragments</h2>

        <div>
            <p>
                A Fragment is a piece of an activity which enable more modular activity design.
                It will not be wrong if we say, a fragment is a kind of sub-activity.
            </p>

        <div>
            <p>
                •&emsp;A fragment has its own layout and its own behaviour with its own life cycle callbacks.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;You can add or remove fragments in an activity while the activity is running.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;A fragment can be used in multiple activities.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;Fragment life cycle is closely related to the life cycle of its host activity which means
                when the activity is paused, all the fragments available in the activity will also be stopped.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;A fragment can implement a behaviour that has no user interface component.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;Fragments should not communicate with each other directly.
                They should communicate through the host activity.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;Therefore, fragments should define an interface and require that the hosting activity implements this interface.&ensp;<br/>
                •&emsp;A Fragment can check whether a hosting activity correctly implements this interface in the Fragment’s onAttach() method.&ensp;

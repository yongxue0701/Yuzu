        <h2>Introduction of Shared Preferences</h2>

        <p>
            SharedPreferences is a simple way to read and write simple key-value pairs of data to
            storage. If we go deep into understanding of word: shared means to distribute data
            within and preference means something important or preferable, so SharedPreferences
            data is shared and preferred data.<br/>
            Shared Preference can be used to save primitive data
            type: string, long, int, float and Boolean.

            <b>What Is Preference File?</b><br/>
            Before we begin explaining shared preference, it is important to understand
            preference file.<br/>
            A preference file is actually a xml file saved in internal memory of device.
            Every application have some data stored in memory in a directory data/data/application
            package name so whenever getSharedPreferences(String name,int mode) function
            get called it validates the file that if it exists or it doesn't exist, then
            a new xml is created with passed name.
